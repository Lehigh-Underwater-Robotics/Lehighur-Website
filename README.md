## Get Started

To make life simple, you can preview the website locally using `hugo` before you commit and push them online. In the `Lehihgur-Website` folder, run: 

```hugo server -D
hugo server -D
```

The output is like this: 

```$ hugo server -D

Open a browse and go to `http://localhost:1313/`. Note that at this point, it is only local preview. If you are satisfied with the change, git add, commit, and push the changes to github. We used [vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy the website, this action is done automatically as soon as you push the changes to github. 



## What You Can Do

### Add sections and sub-sections

The `config.toml` is the site config file. To add more sections, follow this pattern and grammar. 

![s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baboonSTW/Blog-img/main/202209181429708.png)

After you create the new section, create the folder under `content/` with the same name as `<URL>`, or the website will not know where to redirect and you will get `404 page not found` error. 

### 

In `content/<section>/`, there are two files normally. `_index.md` is the meta description of the section. You can change the title of this section. `<other>.md` contains the content of this section.
